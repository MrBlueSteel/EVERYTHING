# Please take the time to read the following:
The following .zip files contain most of the 300-400 level classes from the old computer engineering curriculum.
You may find out that some of the files have errors in them.
This is because all files are given as is. 
As in, these are submitted either on myCourses or directly into a professor's mailbox. 
The scores for each class and assignment will be updated regularly below.
Some of the grades are not representative as they are either late or regraded.

# Legal stuff but not that legal stuff:
You are allowed to use any of this but please give credit where it is due. 
Also, please don't plagiarize. If you do plagiarize, put some effort into it.
Basically don't hand in my assignment without looking at it because it'll probably have my name on it.
At least take off my name or something seriously.

## Other less important stuff:
Other classes' files like ECSE428 which does not include code in this repository will be hyperlinked properly in the grades section.
Some of the .zip files will be incomplete either because I can't find the code or my partners have them and I'm too lazy to go ask.
There will be comments for each class.
Please ignore some of the comments inside of my code ~~because they might be explicit and I got lazy and didn't delete them~~.
All group projects will have team members names next to the grade.

## ECSE 415: Introduction to Computer Vision (Winter 2017 - Prof. James Clark) 
TAs: Siavash Gorji and Gary Corcoran

Assignments: A1 = 86.25%; A2 = 83%; A3 = 56%; A4 = 65%

Project (with Alexander Makrigiorgos): 88%

Comments: Very nice class. You learn a lot and you get to understand computer graphics as a whole. 
The assignments were not super hard, but assignment 3 had a lot of algorithm implementation so almost everyone had a hard time.
I gave in assignment 4 late ~~because I'm a dumbass~~.
The final exam was a hassle though. Not as hard as expected, but I was still very unprepared and had a hard time. 
Overall, I really liked the class but not the final exam.
I would recommend this tech com to everyone.




I spent too much time making this you guys better be grateful
